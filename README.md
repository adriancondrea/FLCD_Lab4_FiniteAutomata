# FLCD_Lab4_FiniteAutomata

This project was developed during the Formal Languages and Compiler Design Course, Babes-Bolyai University Cluj-Napoca, year 3, semester 1

Write a program that:

1. Reads the elements of a FA (from file)

2. Displays the elements of a finite automata, using a menu: the set of states, the alphabet, all the transitions, the set of final states.

3. For a DFA, verify if a sequence is accepted by the FA.


Deliverables: 

FA.in - input file (on Github)

Source code (on Github)

Documentation. It should also include in BNF or EBNF format the form in which the FA.in file should be written (on Moodle and Github)


Max grade = 9

Max grade = 10: Use FA to detect tokens <identifier> and <integer constant> in the scanner program
